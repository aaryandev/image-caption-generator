# Dataset
The image caption generator leverages the Flickr30K dataset, which consists of approximately 30,000 images, each accompanied by five descriptive captions. Other datasets, such as Flickr8k and MSCOCO, are also available for similar purposes.

Created a dictionary that uses the image name (without the extension type) as the key. The corresponding value is a list of five captions for that particular image. The dataset contain a large number of words, and here are the top 50 most occurring and least occurring words:
